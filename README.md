# Sub-Atomic

  ## Description
   This is an app designed to make the process of a finding a substitutue teacher faster and easier. To use this app, users need to sign up through the signup form. They then have an option to be an Admin (teacher) and be able to post jobs, or sign up as a substitute to see and apply for jobs. When an applicant applies for a job, the Admins can see their profiles attached to that specific job and contact them as needed. Both types of users are able to add and save relevant information to their profile.
   

   
   ### Technologies Used:
   
   
   
'Sub Atomic' uses the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) tech stack. It combines a back-end implemented with Node.js and Express.js API with a MongoDB database using a React front-end to create a single-page MERN application.

   GraphQL - A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with your existing data, giving clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. For this application, we used the graphql package to parse GraphQL syntax in both our front-end and back-end codebase.

Apollo Server - An open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client, the client we used in our MERN application. We used the apollo-server-express package to integrate GraphQL into our Express.js server, and the @apollo/client package to make requests from our React front end to the GraphQL API.

React Router - A collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application, allowing you to make your single-page React applications behave more like multi-page applications. We used the react-router-dom npm package to work with React Router in our applications.

Concurrently npm package - Allows you to run multiple processes, or servers, from a single command-line interface. Rather than opening multiple terminals to start the multiple servers, you can run them both at the same time. It also allows you to keep track of different outputs in one place, and will stop all of your processes if even one of them fails.

JSON Web Tokens, or JWTs - An alternative to using session cookies for authentication. We used the jsonwebtoken package in our MERN applications.

jwt-decode - A npm package that helps decode JWTs from their Base64Url encoding. We used it to extract non-sensitive data such as the token’s expiration date to see if it’s expired before making a request to the server.

The nodemon package - Simplifies your development environment by automatically restarting your Node.js applications when file changes in the directory are detected.
